# KBodolai_repo
Repository containing a variety of python code I generated while I learned to code and Machine Learning

In short it contains: 
# L_Systems
Lindenmayer systems. A type of formal grammar, here used to depict plant-like structures, but can also be used to create fractals with the right seed.
# Computer Vision 
vbt.py is a script where I apply computer vision techniques to sports science. From a live video stream specifying a line length in the frame and hsv threshold values it computes the velocity, and have implemented the functionality of warrning the user when it transitions to the fatigue regime (v lowers 20%). The latest version is more organized with other functionalities, such as detailing an exercise and the desired intensity level so the user can figure out the weight needed and he can infer his max strength. I have uploaded this older version because it is more straightforward.
# Machine Learning
2 projects listed here, a Binary Image classifier using CNNs (which I trained to get an accuracy of  ~95% and a Transformer for Natural Language Processing. I have more work on time series that were done as part of a team, so I can't post as my own, but I can show if asked to.
